# Why I use python
My starting language is C++, and I considered C++ the best programming language and despise any other languages. I have heard that Linus Torvalds considers C++ the worst language, but I was still immersed in the coolest grammar C++ contains.

As time went by and my programming knowledge got deeper, I gradually knew that a lot of things to be considered when developing software more than  **Speed**. C++ is quick when running, but not quick in developing because many wheels needs to be rewritten. Garbage-Collection should also be considered, which C++ doesn't contain. in short, C++ has countless limitations.
> Life is short, I use python.

> Velified python when youthful; Understand python when growing up; Use python when getting mature.

In short:

**Python makes focus on mathmatical solutions, thinking and developing, instead of boring grammar problems**
